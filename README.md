# Overview
I created an interactive dashboard using bacterial data collected from volunteers.
In this project I accomplished:
- Creating basic plots using plotly (bar, line, and pie charts).
- Used D3.json() to retrieve external data, a data file in json format in this instance.
- Parsed data in json format.
- Used Javascript to manipulate the data.
- Implemented event handlers to make the dashboard interactive.
